					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<p>Diaphorikos was made by 4 high school students from William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. as a MCV4U0 culminating project. You can find it on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Diaphorikos/Direction-Field-Calculator">here</a>.</p>
					<p>As stated on the home page, the calculator is inspired by the graphing calculator Desmos. However, Desmos has its limitations when it comes to derivatives. It can graph derivatives, and even some simple antiderivatives, but it does not provide an intuitive way of handling differential equations. Additionally, creating a slope graph requires a lot of manual work, and still does not provide you with a visual solution. Diaphorikos is meant to fill that gap.</p>
					<p>Diaphorikos is capable of graphing differential equations thanks to Euler’s method. Euler’s method is a first order method of analytically approximating such an equation. To put it simply, for every point added to the approximation, the error of each individual point is reduced by an inverse square, and the overall error by an inverse linear factor. Euler’s method is considered one of the simplest methods of sketching curves based on their differential. This is because it simply consists of taking the slope at a given point (which can be determined from the differential equation), and using a line segment with a given run to determine the next point (like a series of linear approximations). The process is then repeated. If you want a more in-depth analysis of Euler’s method, you can check out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method"> Wikipedia article </a>, or visit <a href="http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/EulersMethod.aspx">Paul's Online Notes</a> or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc/bc-differential-equations-new/bc-7-5/v/eulers-method">Khan Academy</a>.</p>
					<p>The development process for this website followed basic principles of the engineering process. First, a goal was set, and the requirements were determined. A prototype was made soon after, and once preliminary testing was carried out, full fledged development began. The entire website was structured to follow principles of IPO (Input, Processing, Output). At every step, rigorous testing was completed to find issues and determine limitations. When the whole thing finally worked together, a few individuals acted as preliminary clients, and changes based on collected criticism were made. Finally, the product was ready to be presented.</p>
					<p>Fun facts:
						<ul>
							<li><i>Diaphorikos</i> (<i>διαφορικός</i>) is the Greek word for differential, derived from the ancient Greek word for "difference", <i>diaphora</i> (<i>διαφορά</i>).</li>
							<li>The project is dedicated to our amazing MCV4U0 teacher, Mrs. Gugoiu.</li>
							<li>The website uses both the bootstrap and mathquill libraries. This is possible if you avoid touching their bounding boxes.</li>
